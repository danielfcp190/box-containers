BOX-CONTAINERS - APP

This App has the objective of creating boxes and containers models in a controlled way, being able to be done manually or through a json containing the information regarding the pattern that you want to visualize, or both simultaneously. The users can also choose the color of the boxes by clicking on each one of them and choosing the color they prefer.
After finishing the assembly of boxes and containers, users will be able to view the model in json format and save it in an external database.
Users will be able to verify the model through the id generated by clicking "save json".

This project was built in Next.js, using Javascript, Redux, Styled-components, MongoDB, Axios, Express.
